# Terms of Service

## Introduction

By using Alter Ego (the "Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service. These terms will apply to anyone who adds the bot to
or uses the bot on a Discord server.

## Bot Purpose

Alter Ego is designed to assist in the running of text-based roleplays on Discord. It does this by managing environments, characters
and items, as well as aiding players in navigation, communication and item management. This service is delivered through a Discord
App, which will react to certain commands, interactions and messages on your Discord server with messages in channels.

## User Responsibilities

* Users of the Bot must comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, and must not use the Bot in any way which violate these terms.
* Users of the Bot must not use the Bot for any illegal purposes, spamming or scamming.
* Users of the Bot must not attempt to deliberately exploit the Bot, attempt to damage, crash or otherwise deny service of the Bot in any way.

## Data Collection and Privacy

The Bot may collect user, server and channel IDs for the purpose of helping you run your roleplay. For more information, refer to
our Privacy Policy.

## Limitations of Liability

We are not responsible for any harm, data loss, or other issues resulting from using the Bot.

## Modifications

We may update these Terms at any time, with a notification in the #announcements channel on the support server. Continued use of the Bot after
changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Termination

We reserve the right to block or ban users who violate these Terms.
