Open this tab, and you should see Alter Ego listed under Bots and Apps.</p> <p></p> <p>Press Manage to open Alter Ego's management page. Here, you can choose which roles and members have access to the bot, which channels the bot can be used in, and even control which specific commands can be used by which users.</p> <p>Although the bot will only allow users with Administrator permission to use admin commands anyway, it is still highly recommended that you restrict your players from accessing admin commands. This is because restricting the admin commands here will remove them from your players' command lists, therefore making it clearer to them which commands they are allowed to use.</p> <p>The full list of admin commands you should restrict is:</p> <ul> <li><code>/adminhelp</code></li> <li><code>/character</code></li> <li><code>/door</code></li> <li><code>/item</code></li> <li><code>/object</code></li> <li><code>/room</code></li> </ul> <p>To restrict a command, first press the command from the Commands list, then press Add roles or members. Then, select any roles or members you would like to restrict the command from, such as <code>@everyone</code>. Then, press Add, and finally, toggle the switch to the \"deny\" position. It should look like the image below if done correctly. Finally, press Save to save your changes.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"setup-guide/#creating-rooms","title":"Creating Rooms","text":"<p>Rooms represent the environments that characters will exist in. Each room acts as a distinct place in your setting which characters can enter, explore, and interact with each other in. Each room also acts as a separate chat room, meaning characters in the same room will be able to directly communicate with each other, while characters in different rooms cannot.</p> <p>To set up a room, simply use the <code>/room create</code> command. This command has the following parameters:</p> Parameter Type Description name required The name of the room. This will be how you reference the room in commands. Every room must have a unique name between 1 and 32 characters long. description required The description of the room. You can use this field to describe the general layout of the room, including any key objects or features of the room which would be noticeable to characters. Must be between 1 and 1500 characters. capacity optional The capacity of the room. This is the maximum weight of all of the items that can fit into the room. If a room is full, characters will not be able to drop items there. Must be a number between 0 and 1,000,000. Defaults to 0 if not set. <p>Once you have created a room, you will be able to check that it's set up correctly with the <code>/room look</code> command.

Every character in your roleplay must be assigned to a different text channel, and anyone who can post messages in that channel will be able to roleplay as that character. Therefore, the first step to setting up a character is to create the channel, and manage its permissions.</p> <p>Let's say we want to make a character called Makoto. To do this, we first need to create a text channel. In this case, let's create a channel called <code>#makoto</code>:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, we want to control who can roleplay as Makoto. To do this, let's open the channel's settings, and go to the Permissions tab. If we don't want everyone to be able to roleplay as Makoto, then we should disable the Send Messages permission for <code>@everyone</code> in this channel:</p> <p></p> <p>We could also remove the View Channel permission, if we wanted to control who can spectate this character.</p> <p>Next, we need to give access to any users or roles we want to be able to play as the character. We can do this by selecting them from the Roles/Members list, and finding the user or role we want to be able to play as that character. Then, we can give that user or role the Send Messages permission:</p> <p></p> <p>Now that we've configured the channel, we can create a character using the <code>/character create</code> command. This command has the following parameters:</p> Parameter Type Description name required The name of the character. This will be how you reference the character in commands. Every character must have a unique name between 1 and 32 characters long. channel required The channel linked to this character. Anyone with the permission to send messages in this channel will be able to roleplay as this character. Every character must be linked to a unique text channel in your server. description required The description of the character. You can use this field to describe the appearance of the character, including any key features of the character which would be noticeable to characters. Must be between 1 and 1500 characters. room required The name of the room the character is in. Every character must be placed into a room. display_name optional The display name of the character. If set, this will override the character's name in all places where their name is displayed, including as the username when sending messages as the character. This is useful if you want to display a more complex name for a character (e.g. first and last name) while keeping the character's name used in commands simple. Must be between 1 and 32 characters. picture optional The image URL of the character. This will be used as the user icon when sending messages as the character. items_capacity optional The capacity of the character's inventory. This is the maximum weight of all of the items that the character can carry. If the inventory is full, the character cannot hold any more items. Must be a number between 0 and 1,000,000. Defaults to 0 if not set. clothes_capacity optional The capacity of the character's clothes. This is the maximum weight of all of the items that the character can wear. If the inventory is full, the character cannot wear any more items. Must be a number between 0 and 1,000,000. Defaults to 0 if not set. hidden optional Whether the character is hidden. A hidden character cannot be seen by other characters. Defaults to false if not set. frozen optional Whether the character is frozen. A frozen character cannot move to different rooms. Defaults to false if not set. npc optional Whether the character is an NPC. An NPC character is immune from freeze-all and move-all functions. This is useful for admin-controlled characters who you do not want to be affected by these functions. Defaults to false if not set. <p>Once you have created a character, you will be able to check that it's set up correctly with the <code>/character look</code> command.

They can be used to enrich your setting, and increase the immersion and interactiveness or your roleplay.</p> <p>Before you create an item, you will need to select which inventory you would like to create the inventory in. There are four types of inventory you can select. These are:</p> <ul> <li>Room Items - The items currently in a room.

You can select a character's inventory with <code>/character items</code>.</li> <li>Character Clothes - The clothes a character is wearing. You can select a character's clothes inventory with <code>/character clothes</code>.</li> <li>Storage - An extra inventory which comes with your roleplay. This is useful for storing items you currently don't want to put anywhere. You can select your roleplay's storage inventory with <code>/item storage</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Once you have selected an inventory, that inventory will remain selected until you select a different inventory. This means you can keep creating multiple items in the same inventory without needing to reselect it.</p> <p>After you have selected an inventory, you can create an item using the <code>/item create</code> command.

Defaults to 1 if not set. wearable optional Whether the item is wearable. If an item is wearable, then characters will be able to wear them. Defaults to false if not set. infinite optional Whether the item can be taken infinitely. This is useful to set up items which you want characters to be able to take as many times as they want. Defaults to false if not set. keyword optional If set, then characters holding this item will be able to lock and unlock doors which are set to a key lock, and have the same keyword. <p>Once you have created an item, you will be able to check that it's set up correctly with the <code>/item look</code> command. This will show you all the details of the item, and give you options to edit and delete the item if you need to change anything.
